**Benchmarking Detection Transfer Learning with Vision Transformers** [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11429)]

The work presents training techniques that can minimize the challenges like slow-training, high-memory consumption, unknown training formulae, architectural differences and incompatibility. Furthermore, gave great insight and shows the better usage of ViT for detection (which contains the above mentioned challenges).
